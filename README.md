## General Info
A project to practice JavaScript and implementing Local Storage for Turing's Front-End Engineering course, Module 1.

## Motivation
Check Yo' Self is a project assigned as a student at Turing. We were given static comps to recreate which included styling details for desktop and mobile layouts. We implemented JavaScript to create an interactive application that allows the user to create new to-do lists and add as many tasks as they'd like. The user also has the ability to create, delete, mark as urgent and check off each task on their lists.

## Built With
* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript
